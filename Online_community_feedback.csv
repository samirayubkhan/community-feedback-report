","If ALX wanted to introduce one thing that could make a big impact, I’d suggest a structured “Skill-to-Opportunity Bridge Program”—a mix of mentorship, real-world projects, and direct job placement pipelines.

Resource: An exclusive, searchable directory of ALX graduates’ skills, with portfolios linked, accessible to vetted hiring partners.

Group: A dedicated “Career Acceleration Circle” for each cohort—small peer groups with an assigned industry mentor, meeting twice a month to work on projects, review résumés, and share opportunities.","Hosting or co-hosting an online or in-person event, Moderating a discussion channel or interest group, Sharing content (e.g., writing articles, sharing resources), Mentoring another member",Yes,No don't have suggestions for now

Other than people that live in Africa, ALX also has students in the diaspora. I think if groups are created based on these countries it can better foster networking and it can create some kind of competition among us to ""represent"".

ALX should introduce a CSR program were graduants will do some kind of community service as a requirement before graduation. It can be online or in person. This way, students get to have real world practical experience before graduation and also ALX can see what is actually working for their students and what's not. This can also weed out lazy students as well 

I love the PF program, it's like a degree program on its own! the structure, the subtle jokes, the images, the curriculum is  well planned and executed, at a point I had to Google the man behind the curriculum because he impressed me! I think I read he is a follow Ghanaian, so proud of us!! Well done 👍 however, at a point I think week 9 or so, it gets overwhelming. So much to do and remember. Maybe work on simplifying things a bit. I know it's a self passed learning thing but introduce a Lecturer or something along the line. It gets too overwhelming and the motivation begins to dry out.

I don't know if it was mentioned and I skipped that part but most of us didn't know that the PF course was a requirement. We thought we were going straight to our specializations. In the future please exercise full disclosure, or if it's there and I'm the one that didn't know ignore this part!!

Also the check your understanding quizzes. They seem more like check your retention and memorization than check your understanding. There should be room to answer quizzes in our own words based on the lecture not to repeat the words in the lecture notes.

ALX should intensify their ""quality control"" when it comes to milestone submissions. Some do not follow guidelines and others are heavily reliant on artificial intelligence. I'm sure if proper checks and balances are done, all these can be taken care of.

We should especially remember that quality is always better than quantity, at the end of the day we will carry ALX certifications to the working world and if we don't meet community standards, ALX will start to loose credibility out there which will be very unfortunate.

I keep reading about community ambassadors but I don't know them, maybe introduce them to us well or choose the ambassadors from the current individual programs, that way we will definitely know them and they will be a voice for us to ""management""

The Alumni can create a foundation like the Mastercard foundation to also help others, we can donate to this foundations and it will be properly regulated to help other needy Africans through sponsorship.
We will be paying forward the kindness and subsidy we received from ALX and mastercard foundation. Voluntarily of course!

Lastly, as someone that loves watching her animations. I enjoy the ones in the weekly modules. They make me happy. I want more!! Oh also in the modules during breaks there are music videos for us to release tension and enjoy, I'm speaking for myself, music isn't my thing, comedy or movies! Give us options 😉 introduce us to new movies or comedy as well so it can be a fair balance 😂

Secondly, the zoom sessions, could be more useful if they were stright to the point instead of all those jokes or whatever things get said at the beginning for like 15 minutes or so, maybe that's also why we as Africans dont really use our time well, we tend to waste time on uncalled for things, people coming for value in a meeting like these, get on with it...or tell us the first 15 to 2 minutes wiĺl be used for such and such...so we come in on the right time and leave as well, at the right time."

This would make it so much easier to organize discussions around specific topics or projects. Having designated places for smaller teams to collaborate would enhance communication and help keep conversations focused. It can feel overwhelming when everything gets mixed together, and sub-groups could offer a clear solution. Plus, it would allow for more targeted brainstorming sessions and reduce the noise in our main channels. I really believe that this feature could elevate our collaboration experience and lead to more productive outcomes."
